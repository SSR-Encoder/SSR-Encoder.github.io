  <h2 style="text-align:center;">Abstract</h2>
  <p>Recent advancements in subject-driven image generation have led to zero-shot generation, yet precise selection and focus on crucial subject representations remain challenging. Addressing this, we introduce the SSR-Encoder, a novel architecture designed for selectively capturing any subject from single or multiple reference images. It responds to various query modalities including text and masks, without necessitating test-time fine-tuning. The SSR-Encoder combines a Token-to-Patch Aligner that aligns query inputs with image patches and a Detail-Preserving Subject Encoder for extracting and preserving fine features of the subjects, thereby generating subject embeddings. These embeddings, used in conjunction with original text embeddings, condition the generation process. Characterized by its model generalizability and efficiency, the SSR-Encoder adapts to a range of custom models and control modules. Enhanced by the Embedding Consistency Regularization Loss for improved training, our extensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in versatile and high-quality image generation, indicating its broad applicability.</p>

  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>Recent advancements in image generation, especially with the advent of text-to-image diffusion models trained on extensive datasets, have revolutionized this field. A prime example is Stable Diffusion, an open-source model, which allows a broad user base to easily generate images from textual prompts. A growing area of interest that has emerged is the subject-driven generation, where the focus shifts from creating a generic subject, like ``a cat'' to generating a specific instance, such as ``the cat''. However, crafting the perfect text prompt to generate the desired subject content poses a significant challenge. Consequently, researchers are exploring various strategies for effective subject-driven generation. Subject-driven image generation aims to learn subjects from reference images and generate images aligning with specific concepts like identity and style. Currently, one prominent approach involves test-time fine-tuning, which, while efficient, requires substantial computational resources to learn each new subject. Another approach encodes the reference image into an image embedding to bypass the fine-tuning cost. However, these encoder-based models typically require joint training with the base diffusion model, limiting their generalizability. A concurrent work, IP-adapter, tackles both fine-tuning costs and generalizability by learning a projection to inject image information into the U-Net, avoiding the need to fine-tune the base text-to-image model, thereby broadening its application in personalized models. Despite these advancements, a critical aspect often overlooked is the extraction of the most informative representation of a subject. With images being a complex mixture of subjects, backgrounds, and styles, it's vital to focus on the most crucial elements to represent a subject effectively. To address this, we introduce the SSR-Encoder, an image encoder that generates Selective Subject Representations for subject-driven image generation. </p>

  <h2>Approach</h2>
<p>Selective subject-driven image generation aims to generate target subjects in a reference image with high fidelity and creative editability, guided by the user's specific queries (text or mask). To tackle this, we propose our SSR-Encoder, a specialized framework designed to integrate with any custom diffusion model without necessitating test-time fine-tuning. Formally, for a given reference image <math>\mathit{I}<math> and a user query <math>\mathit{q}<math>, the SSR-Encoder effectively captures subject-specific information and generates multi-scale subject embeddings <math>\mathit{c_s}<math>. These multi-scale subject embeddings <math>\mathit{c_s}<math> are subsequently integrated into the U-Net model with trainable copies of cross-attention layers. The generation process, conditioned on both subject embeddings <math>c_s<math> and text embedding <math>c_t<math>, allows for the production of desired subjects with high fidelity and creative editability.</p>

  <p>Given a query text-image pairs $\left(q, I\right)$, the SSR-Encoder employs a token-to-patch aligner to highlight the selective regions in the reference image by the query. It extracts more fine-grained details of the subject through the detail-preserving subject encoder, projecting multi-scale visual embeddings via the token-to-patch aligner.
    Then, we adopt subject-conditioned generation to generate specific subjects with high fidelity and creative editability.
    During training, we adopt reconstruction loss $L_{LDM}$ and embedding consistency regularization loss $L_{reg}$ for selective subject-driven learning.</p>

  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>Results for re-contextualization of a bag and vase subject instances. By finetuning a model using our method we are able to generate different images of the a subject instance in different environments, with high preservation of subject details and realistic interaction between the scene and the subject. We display the conditioning prompts below each image. </p>

  <h2>Art Rendition</h2>
  <p>Original artistic renditions of our subject dog in the style of famous painters. We remark that many of the generated poses were not seen in the training set, such as the Van Gogh and Warhol rendition. We also note that some renditions seem to have novel composition and faithfully imitate the style of the painter - even suggesting some sort of creativity (extrapolation given previous knowledge).</p>

  <h2>Text-Guided View Synthesis</h2>
  <p>Our technique can synthesized images with specified viewpoints for a subject cat (left to right: top, bottom, side and back views). Note that the generated poses are  different from the input poses, and the background changes in a realistic manner given a pose change. We also highlight the preservation of complex fur patterns on the subject cat's forehead.</p>

  <h2>Property Modification</h2>
  <p>We show color modifications in the first row (using prompts ``a [color] [V] car''), and crosses between a specific dog and different animals in the second row (using prompts ``a cross of a [V] dog and a [target species]''). We highlight the fact that our method preserves unique visual features that give the subject its identity or essence, while performing the required property modification.</p>

  <h2>Accessorization</h2>
  <p>Outfitting a dog with accessories. The identity of the subject is preserved and many different outfits or accessories can be applied to the dog given a prompt of type <em>"a [V] dog wearing a police/chef/witch outfit''</em>. We observe a realistic interaction between the subject dog and the outfits or accessories, as well as a large variety of possible options.</p>

  <h2>Societal Impact</h2>
  <p>This project aims to provide users with an effective tool for synthesizing personal subjects (animals, objects) in different contexts. While general text-to-image models might be biased towards specific attributes when synthesizing images from text, our approach enables the user to get a better reconstruction of their desirable subjects. On contrary, malicious parties might try to use such images to mislead viewers. This is a common issue, existing in other generative models approaches or content manipulation techniques. Future research in generative modeling, and specifically of personalized generative priors, must continue investigating and revalidating these concerns.</p>
